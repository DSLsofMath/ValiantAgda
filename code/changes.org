* 2023-09-08: Updating the code to current Agda + stdlib
+ There were a number of (arguably minor) changes needed:
+ Three renamings / moves:
  + Relation/Binary/On.agda -> Relation/Binary/Construct/On.agda
  + Relation.Binary.EqReasoning -> Relation.Binary.Reasoning.Setoid
  + Algebra.FunctionProperties -> Algebra.Definitions
+ records need new modifier
    eta-equality
  to allow for pattern-matching (with eta-equality) on the constructor.
+ IsCommutativeMonoid record rationalised in the library (Error: "The
  record type IsCommutativeMonoid does not have the fields
  isSemigroup, identityË¡ but it would have the field isMonoid ...".)
